- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaximilianPs
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming creation and development, I'm pretty good in prototyping, and game design and reasech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c# and still working on Unity from 🤔 25 years?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my own project which is an Medieval RPG with randomic factions, on a randomic land, with randomic quests based on faction's resources... still an amazin project which is moving forward pretty slowly 'cause I'm alone with my freelancers friends.
